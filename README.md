This repository contains the scripts for the analysis of a chip-seq dataset for SUC2CO and SUC2CO-aba mutants in Arabidopsis thaliana.
Part of the code for peak calling and filtering has been taken from https://github.com/sklasfeld/GreenscreenProject (see paper at https://academic.oup.com/plcell/article/34/12/4795/6705244), but has been adapted to identify robust peaks across replicates with IDR.
Scripts can be run in order, data will be soon be available on public repositories and will be linked here.
